\section{The Discovery of the Higgs Boson \cite{higgs}}
The discovery of the Higgs boson was finally anounced on the 4th of July 2012. The ATLAS and CMS collaboration both confirmed the discovery of a Higgs like particle. The discovery of the Higgs boson closed some serious question of the Standard Model like the origin of mass.
\subsection{Theoretical principle}
The Standard Model describes the properties and interaction of elementary particles with gauge theories. It was experimemtally determined, that several particles carry a mass. The problem is that the electroweak symmetry requieres massless particles, since the explicit mass terms would break it. The solution was found in 1964 by proposing the Higgs mechanism. The Higgs field $\Phi$ is a isospin doublet of complex scalar fields:
\begin{align*}
  \Phi &=
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\Phi^+ \\
		\Phi^0
		\end{pmatrix}
	= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \Phi_1 + i \Phi_2 \\
    \Phi_3 + i \Phi_4
  \end{pmatrix}
		& <\Phi> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
		\begin{pmatrix}
			0 \\
			v
		\end{pmatrix}
		& \;\; \text{with} \;\; v = \sqrt{-\frac{\mu^2}{\lambda}}
\end{align*}
The Higgs potential is a mexican hat potential and therefore the electroweak symmetry is spontanously broken. The initial Higgs field has four degrees of freedom, after the SSB three are observed by the weak gauge boson masses and the forth leads to the Higgs Boson. The development around the minimum leads to explicit mass terms for the gauge bosons $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^0$. In addition do the fermions get their masses by the Yukawa interaction and couple to the Higgs Boson. \\
The Higgs boson is a scalar with Spin 0. It couples to all particles proportional to their mass and due to the selfcoupling term gets a mass itself. Due to the high mass it has a short lifetime. The Higgs boson can be produced as fussion or radiation of massive particles since it couples to mass. The highest production of the Higgs boson is due gluon fusion, that couple couple to a quark loop or decay into a $q\bar{q}$ pair. But even under the LHC conditions the probability for Higgs production is extrem small. There is just one in $10^9$ events. In principle the Higgs boson can decay in every massive particle, but the upper limit is $m_H\approx \frac{m_{decay}^2}{2}$. There are also decays into $Z\gamma$ or $gg$ possible over loops. The problem was, that the branching fraction highly depends on the actually mass of the Higgs boson and many channels have a high background.
\subsection{Statistics}
The Higgs boson creates an signal excess at a specific invariant mass. Due to the high backgrounds that can also fluctuate, it is important to evaluate the significance of the signal. Different terms from the statistics are important to understand why the discovery of the Higgs boson was possible.\\
The signal strength $\mu$ is directly connected to the counting rate $n=\mu(\text{signal})+\text{background}$ and defined by $\mu = \frac{\sigma(m_H)}{\sigma_{\text{SM}}(m_H)}$. A hypothesis gives the probability of a set of possible results. The \textit{p-value} gives the proporbility for the excess to be generated by fluctuation with the hypothesis that there is no signal. The smaller the the p-value is the less likely it the hypothesis. The \textit{level of significance} is a chosen level $\alpha$ to reject the hypothesis for $p<\alpha$. The \textit{confidence interval} contains the true calues with a specific value. In particle physics the usually chosen \textit{confidence level} (CL)is \SI{95}{\percent} CL. This allows to set limits based on measured data with a specific CL.
The Likelihood ratio $q_0 = -2 \log \left(\frac{L(BG)}{L(\mu S+BG)}\right)$ can be used to reject a hypothesis if $q_0>\alpha$, but it is not reliable for low sensitivity experiments since the distributions are too similar.\\
For the $CL_s$ method are two pdfs of the test statistic $Q$ created with a fixed mass hypothesis. One distribution is created with the background and one with the background with signal hypithesis. Afterwards the $p$ value of both distributions is calculated respectivley to the observed $Q_{/text{obs}}$. The \textit{signal confidence value} is thus $CL_s = \frac{p(S+BG)}{1-p(BG)}$. The signal-background hypothesis is rejected at \SI{95}{\percent} CL for $CL_s\leq 0.05$.
\subsection{Previous results}
The CDF and D\O\; collaborations at Tevatron set the Higgs mass limits to be either $m_H<\SI{162}{\GeV}$ or $m_H>\SI{166}{\GeV}$ at \SI{95}{\percent} CL. The experiments at the LEP collider performed $\chi^2$ tests to precision measurements of electroweak observables. This allows to extract mass limits for $m_H$, since the the Higgs boson contributes in loop corrections to the electroweak propagator. The best fit value was between $95$ and \SI{105}{\GeV}, but this region was already excluded by direct searches. Together with other results from direct searches the limit was set to $m_H < \SI{158}{\GeV}$.

The LHC is a \SI{27}{\kilo\meter} hadron collider build to discover the Higgs boson. The LHC contains two general purpose detectors, ATLAS and CMS, with the main goal to find the Higgs boson. Their physics programme contains also the search for new physics i.e. SUSY particles. The idea was to build two experiments to independently valid the results and minimize systematic uncertainties with different detector designs. Both experiments conatin a tracking system, a solenoid, calorimeter and muon detectors. The main difference is that ATLAS placed the solenoid before the calorimeters, while CMS placed the solenoid behind them.\\
ATLAS and CMS mainly concentrated on the two channels $H\rightarrow ZZ^* \rightarrow 4l$ and $H\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ since they have the best properties. Other channel have a significant large background due to undetectable neutrinos or QCD processes that produce further jets.\\
Both collaborations could exclude masses above \SI{129}{\GeV}, but had no signifcant excess around \SI{125}{\GeV} with the data from the run 2011. The LHC increased the center of mass energy in 2012 from \SI{7}{\TeV} to \SI{8}{\TeV}. This led to a higher luminosity and increased the production cross section. Both collaborations beformed $CL_s$ tests at a \SI{95}{\percent} CL. ATLAS could not exclude $122<m_H<\SI{131}{\GeV}$ and CMS $122<m_H<\SI{131}{\GeV}$ at the \SI{95}{\percent} CL. Together with the 2011 and 2012 data sets they finally reached significant excess and published the dicovery of a Higgs like particle with 5.9(ATLAS) and 5.0 (CMS) standard deviations in Juni 2012. The new scalar had a mass of
\begin{align*}
	m_H &= 126.0 \pm 0.4\pm0.4 \;\si{\GeV} \;\;(\text{ATLAS})\\
	m_H &= 125.3 \pm 0.4\pm0.5 \;\si{\GeV} \;\; (\text{CMS})
\end{align*}
More measurements of different properties have been performed to confirm that the new found particle is indeed the Higgs boson. They proved the linear couling of the Higgs to massive elementary particles. By determining the new particle to be a spin 0 boson in 2013, they finally anounced that it was indeed the Higgs boson. The most precise measurement is $m_H = 125.10\pm0.14\;\si{\GeV}$. In Oktober 2013 Higgs and Englert were awarded with the Nobel prize for providing the theory of the Higgs mechanism.
